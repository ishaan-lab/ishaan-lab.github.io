	<p>During this scary time, it's important to remain calm. <br>
	A real issue is people breaking quarantine. I understand how restless you all must feel. This is why I have <br>
	created this website. On this website, you can discuss all of your methods of keeping busy, and <br>
	maintaining a positive mindset. You can also find information about the symptons of Corona, what we <br>
	know so far about the virus, and what we can do to help stop this pandemic! If each and every <br>
	one of us take action to keep ourselves safe from the virus, it will help on a nationwide scale!</p>
